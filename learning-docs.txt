ROLLING
In pandas, a rolling window (or just “rolling”) is a way to perform calculations on a sliding window of consecutive data points.
You specify a window size — e.g., 5 days.
For each point in your time series, pandas takes the current day and previous 4 days (5 total) and applies a function (mean, sum, max, etc.).
The result is a smoothed or aggregated version of your data.

TIMING & DRAWDOWN RISK
Timing Risk: 
The risk that you enter or exit a trade at the wrong time, leading to suboptimal returns.
Buying at the peak and selling at the trough can lead to losses, so the timing of trades is critical.
Drawdown risk:
Drawdown is the decline from a peak to a trough in a portfolio or asset price before a new high is reached.
Drawdown risk is the chance of experiencing significant losses during this decline.
