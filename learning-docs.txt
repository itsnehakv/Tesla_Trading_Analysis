ROLLING
In pandas, a rolling window (or just “rolling”) is a way to perform calculations on a sliding window of consecutive data points.
You specify a window size — e.g., 5 days.
For each point in your time series, pandas takes the current day and previous 4 days (5 total) and applies a function (mean, sum, max, etc.).
The result is a smoothed or aggregated version of your data.
